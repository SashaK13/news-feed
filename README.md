# News Feed examples
This repository contains a list of examples of news feed.
You can find in them the \<article\> element and \<template\> element, in the HTML.
In the JavaScript, you can find examples for recycling the template, adding the articles from JavaScript, iterating a list of articles, and paginating the results.

## Example 2: clone template
Uses the \<template\> element, which is cloned for each new article pushed into the HTML.

## Example 3: feed with mockup DB
Uses a mockup function that pretends to provide data from the server, giving a list of articles to push into the HTML.

## Example 4: pagination
Uses a simple pagination method, to reduce the articles list length.

## Example 5: recycling list of containers
Detect the user scroll down events to update the list of articles. The list of articles will be increased by eight every time that the user reaches the bottom of the page, until the full list is appended.

## Example 6: pagination with bootstrap
Using the bootstrap framework, we updated the look and responsiveness of the articles page.
