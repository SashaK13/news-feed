          <h1 class="mt-0">How has Finland's female-led government fared in its first year?</h1>
          <p>Finland made international headlines a year ago when then 34-year-old Sanna Marin became the world's youngest serving prime minister.
            <br><br>
            But that wasn't all that drew global attention: she was in a coalition government made up of five parties all led by women.
            <br><br>
            Stepping into the new government with Marin was Li Andersson (Left Alliance), 32; Maria Ohisalo (Green League), 34; Anna-Maja Henriksson (Swedish People's Party of Finland), 55; and Katri Kulmuni (Centre Party), 32.
            <br><br>
            So, a year on, how has the female-led government done?</p>
          <h2 class="mt-0">Finland 'interested in what other people think about us'</h2>
          <p>Although women remain highly underrepresented in governments worldwide, in Finland, Marin is the fourth female prime minister.
            <br><br>“We have a tradition of female leaders in politics, so it wasn’t very exceptional,” said Johanna Kantola, a professor of gender studies at Tampere University, who said Finns started to realise it was special following the “international hype”.
            <br><br>“We are a small country so we are very interested in what other people think about us. Equality is part of the country’s identity so people followed very much what this government was doing.”
            <br><br>Marin comes from a working class background and was elected to the Tampere City Council at the age of 27. She was first elected to Finland's parliament in 2015.
            <br><br>Leader of the Social Democratic Party, she came into office following a postal strike that forced the previous prime minister and party leader Antti Rinne to resign.</p>
